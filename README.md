# Scripts

Various scripts to make my life easier :)

## Media file importer

`mimport.sh` script is helping to import my `jpg` and `mp4` files into a folder
structure with following pattern: `$TARGET\(videos|photos)\YEAR\MONTH\DAY`.

> I was always after keeping my media organized in a simple way like that, but
> could not find simple tool that would work all the time in different
> situations. This script is as simple as it just might get.
